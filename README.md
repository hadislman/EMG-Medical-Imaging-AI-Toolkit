# EMG & Medical Imaging AI Toolkit

This project demonstrates integrative AI applications in biomedical signal processing and medical imaging. It focuses on using Python to process EMG signals and analyze DICOM medical images.

## Features

- Band-pass filtering and visualization of raw EMG signals
- Feature extraction (mean absolute value, RMS, zero-crossings)
- EMG signal classification using Random Forest
- Loading and viewing DICOM files from medical imaging
- Modular and ready for expansion with deep learning
